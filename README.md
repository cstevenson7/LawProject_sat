#NZA Law group project



Nate - Hosted original repository (initially). Created base python files, and skeleton for HTML files with input form the group. Created the route, model and html page for registration
	
Nibras - Created the routes, models, and html page for updating and deleting case notes
	   
Asia - Created the route, model, and HTML page for the login and logout page. Add a little back-and-forth linking between registratation and login page. Added a bit of functionality so when a user logs in with a unregistered email or invalid password a error message indicates this. Also updated base navbar/footer so when user is logged in the login/register tabs disappear and vise-versa when user is logged out. 
	 
Cindy - Hosted the new master repo after technical issues with the original. Formatted CSS for all new routes created for the project. Created the routes for note retrieval,
        note detail and createnotes
